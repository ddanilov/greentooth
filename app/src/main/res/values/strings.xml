    <string name="help_1">Greentooth can help you save battery and mitigate the security risks of Bluetooth by
        automatically turning Bluetooth off when you\'re no longer using it.</string>
    <string name="help_2">When the last Bluetooth device has disconnected Greentooth will wait for an adjustable amount
        of time in order to not disturb any connection/reconnection attempts and then deactivate Bluetooth.</string>
    <string name="help_3">Greentooth can optionally show an unobtrusive notification when Bluetooth is about to be turned off, allowing
        Bluetooth to be kept on temporarily or Greentooth to be disabled entirely. Please be aware that this feature will not work well if
        the delay is set to a very low value, as there will not be enough time to show the notification.</string>
    <string name="help_4">Please note that Greentooth only runs upon device disconnection, it does not do periodical
        checks for idle Bluetooth.</string>
